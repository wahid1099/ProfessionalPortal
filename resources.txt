git branch creates a new branch which is a new version of the repository as it appears when added, and -M to move the name to main.

git remote add origin finally connects the local folder to the repository on GitHub. It is followed by the repository's link.

git push -u origin main pushes the code to GitHub. The -u flag creates a tracking reference for the branch, and origin main puts the code in the main branch.
